#**Appendix 1. Four prompts for LLMs to assess risk of bias in randomized clinical trials**
### **Direct Command**
Based on the evaluation criteria, assess the risk of bias of RCT. There are three options for the risk of bias: "Low risk," "Unclear risk," and "High risk." There are a total of 7 domains. 1.1Random sequence generation 1.2Allocation concealment 2.1 Blinding of participants and personnel 3.1 Blinding of outcome assessment 4.1 Incomplete outcome data 5.1 Selective reporting 6.1 Other sources of bias.
### **Command with reference**
Based on the evaluation criteria, assess the risk of bias of RCT. There are three options for the risk of bias: "Low risk," "Unclear risk," and "High risk."
The evaluation criteria are as follows:
1.1Random sequence generation
If a random component was used in the sequence generation process, such as computer-generated random numbers, reference to a random number table, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, or drawing lots, minimization with a random element, select “Low risk”.

If no random element was used in generating the allocation sequence or the sequence is predictable, such as sequence generated by odd or even date of birth, sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission, allocation by judgement of the clinician, allocation by preference of the participant, allocation based on the results of a laboratory test or a series of tests, allocation by availability of the intervention, select “High risk”.

If there is insufficient information about the sequence generation process available to permit a judgement of “Low risk” or “High risk”, select “Unclear risk”.

1.2 Allocation concealment
If participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation, select “Low risk”: 
• central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomization); 
• sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; or
• sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.

If participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments, and thus introduce selection bias, due to allocation based on the following, select”High risk”: 
• use of an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); 
• use of assignment envelopes without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); 
• alternation or rotation; 
• date of birth; 
• case record number; or
• any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.

If there is insufficient information available to permit a judgement of ‘low risk’ or ‘high risk’ select “Unclear risk”. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement – for example if the use of assignment envelopes was described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.

2.1 Blinding of participants and personnel
If no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the outcome was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding, or blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken, select “Low risk”.

If no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding, or blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, or either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, and the non-blinding of others likely to introduce bias, select “High risk”.

If there is insufficient information available to permit a judgement of “Low risk” or “High risk”, or the study did not address this outcome, select “Unclear risk”.

3.1 Blinding of outcome assessment 
If there is no blinding of outcome assessment, but the review authors judge that the outcome measurement was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding, or blinding of outcome assessment ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken, select “Low risk”.

If no blinding of outcome assessment, and the outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding, or blinding of outcome assessment, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding, select “High risk”.

If there is insufficient information available to permit a judgement of “Low risk” or “High risk”, or the study did not address this outcome, select “Unclear risk”.

4.1 Incomplete outcome data
If any one of the following, select “Low risk”: 
• no missing outcome data; 
• reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, 
censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); 
• missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for 
missing data across groups;  
• for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk is not enough to have had a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; 
• for continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes is not enough to have had a clinically relevant impact on the observed effect size; or
• missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods.

If any one of the following, select “High risk”: 
• reason for missing outcome data is likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; 
• for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk is enough to have induced clinically relevant bias in the intervention effect estimate; 
• for continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes is enough to have induced clinically relevant bias in the observed effect size; 
• ‘as-treated’ analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomization; or
• potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.

If there is insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit a judgement of “Low risk” or “High risk” (e.g. number randomized not stated, no reasons for missing data provided), or the study did not address this outcome, select “Unclear risk”.

5.1 Selective reporting 
If the study protocol is available and all of the study’s prespecified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the prespecified way, or the study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were prespecified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon), select “Low risk”.

If anyone of the following, select “High risk”: 
• not all of the study’s prespecified primary outcomes have been reported; 
• one or more primary outcomes have been reported using measurements, analysis methods or 
subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not prespecified; 
• one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); 
• one or more outcomes of interest in the review have been reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; or 
• the study report failed to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.

If there is insufficient information available to permit a judgement of “Low risk” or “High risk” (It is likely that the majority of studies will fall into this category. ), select “Unclear risk”.

6. Other sources of bias 
If the study appears to be free of other sources of bias, select “Low risk”.

If there is at least one important risk of bias, select “High risk”. For example, the study: 
• had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; 
• has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or
• had some other problem. 

If there may be a risk of bias, but there is insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists, or insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias, select “Unclear risk”.

### **Formula-constrained output**
## Profile:
- Role: Professional reviewer
- Language: English
- Description: A meticulous and unbiased evaluator with a strong proficiency in learning and applying evaluation criteria for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), capable of assessing the risk of bias based on factual data and strict adherence to guidelines. 
Task Instruction: You need to assess the risk of bias of the RCTs provided. Note the differences between random sequence generation vs. allocation concealment; participant/personnel blinding vs. outcome assessor blinding.

## Constrains:
- Make sure all your judgments are based on the facts reported in the article and not on any extrapolation or speculation of your own. 
- Please strictly follow the skills to evaluate RCTs and strictly follow output format to output, do not speculate positively.

## Definition:
Element “s” represents the content that appears in the text, and set S is the set of content.
Element “e” represents the content derived through inference based on the text, and set E is the set of inferred content.
Based on the judgment results, each article is assigned an evaluation result “r”, r ∈ {“Low risk”, “High risk”, “Unclear risk”}.
Element “R” represents a rule that requires judgment. The numbers following “R” represent the sequence of reasoning, for example, R1 represents the first step of reasoning, and R1.1 is a sub-node under R1, proceeding in order.

## Things to note:
For elements “s”, allow for some fuzzy matching, where the structure, vocabulary, and other elements may vary, but the core meaning remains consistent. For example, “randomization methods” could also be expressed as “randomization method”, “methods of randomization” or “blinding of participants” could be rephrased as “participants being blinded”. Similarly, “sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes” could also be phrased as “opaque, sealed envelopes with sequential numbering” or “sealed envelopes with sequential numbers and opaque material”.

## The detailed process of reasoning:
1.1Random generation
Describe the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.
• R1
S1 = {computer-generated random numbers, reference to a random number table, coin tossing, shuffling cards, shuffling envelopes, throwing dice, drawing lots, minimization with a random element}
R1.1: ∃s (s ∈ S1) is explicitly described in the text. (e.g., “SPSS generated random numbers”, “blocks of size 6 randomized via computer”). 
R1.1.1: Merely mentioning block randomization does not imply that the sequence is generated randomly. Further description, such as “using drawing lots” is necessary.
R1.1.2: Only assign “Low risk” if the study explicitly describes the randomization method in S1 (e.g., “computer-generated random numbers”, “reference to a random number table” etc.). Merely stating “random” is insufficient.
R1.2: No significant baseline differences in demographics or key outcomes. It is necessary to state the distributional characteristics among all groups and evaluate whether they are balanced or not, if the number is basically the same or the p-value is smaller than the pre-determined value, it proves balanced.
R1 = R1.1 ∧ R1.2
If R1 is satisfied, then select “Low risk”
If R1 is not satisfied, then proceed with R2 and R3.

• R2
S2 = {random} 
R2.1: ∃s (s ∈ S2) appears in the text.
R2.2: ¬∃s (s∈ S1) appears in the text.
R2 = R2.1 ∧ R2.2
If R2 is satisfied, then select “Unclear risk”
If R2 is not satisfied, then proceed with R3.

• R3
S3 = {sequence generated by odd, sequence generated by date of birth, sequence generated by some rule based on date, sequence generated by some rule based on day of admission}
E3 = {allocation by judgement of the clinician, allocation by preference of the participant, allocation based on the results of a laboratory test, allocation based on the results of a series of tests, allocation by availability of the intervention}
R3.1: ∃s (s ∈ S3) appears in the text. 
R3.2: ∃e (e ∈ E3) can be inferred from the text. 
R3.3: ¬∃s (s ∈ (S1 ∨ S2)) 
R3 = R3.1 ∨ R3.2 ∨ R3.3
If R3 is satisfied, then select “High risk”

1.2 Allocation concealment
Describe the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to determine whether intervention allocations could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.
• R1
S1 = {central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomization), sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance, “sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes”}
E1 = {neither participants nor investigators enrolling participants could foresee assignment} 
R1.1: ∃s (s ∈ S1) is explicitly described in the text.
R1.1.1: The description should include both the method in S1 and clear details that prevent foreknowledge of the assignment (e.g., stating “sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes” rather than merely “sealed envelopes” or “concealed”).
R1.2: ∃e (e ∈ E1) can be inferred from the text.
R1 = R1.1 ∨ R1.2
If R1 is satisfied, then select “Low risk”
If R1 is not satisfied, then proceed with R2 and R3.

• R2
S2 = {an open random allocation schedule, assignment envelopes without appropriate safeguards, envelopes were unsealed, envelopes were non-opaque, envelopes were not sequentially numbered, alternation, rotation, date of birth, case record number, any other explicitly unconcealed procedure}
R2: ∃s (s ∈ S2) is explicitly described in the text (e.g., unsealed envelopes, non-opaque envelopes)  
If R2 is satisfied, then select “High risk”
If R2 is not satisfied, then proceed with R3.

• R3
E3 = {the concealment process is not mentioned, the concealment process is not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement}
R3.1: ∃e (e ∈ E3) can be inferred from the text
R3.2: Phrases that state allocation was ‘concealed’ without describing the method (e.g., whether envelopes were opaque) should be interpreted as insufficient detail.
R3 = R3.1 ∧ R3.2
If R3 is satisfied, then select “Unclear risk”

2.1 Blinding of participants and personnel
Describe all measures used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Provide any information relating to whether the intended blinding was effective.
• R1
E1 = {blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken, the outcome was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding, the study clearly mentioned it is a blinded trial, the study clearly mentioned both the investigators and the subjects remained blinded to treatment} 
R1.1: ∃e (e ∈ E1) can be inferred from the text. 
R1.2: Blinding must not only be mentioned but also feasible given the intervention characteristics (e.g., use of placebo/sham indistinguishable in procedure, masking sensory differences). Blinding is feasible if the outcome measurement is objective (e.g., biomarkers, mechanical tests) and not influenced by participant/personnel knowledge. 
R1.3: Low risk requires blinding of both participants and key personnel (e.g., therapists, surgeons).
R1 = R1.1 ∧ R1.2 ∧ R1.3
If R1 is satisfied, then select “Low risk”
If R1 is not satisfied, then proceed with R2, R3.

• R2
E2 = {no blinding and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding, incomplete blinding and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding, blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted but likely that the blinding could have been broken, either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded and the non-blinding of others likely to introduce bias} 
R2.1: ∃e (e ∈ E2) can be inferred from the text.
R2.2: If interventions are fundamentally different (e.g., surgical vs. non-surgical, split-mouth or within-subject designs without placebos, acupuncture vs. sham needling with no skin penetration, psychological/educational interventions), participants or personnel could perceive treatment differences (e.g., via side effects, sensory cues, or procedural variations). 
R2 = R2.1 ∧ R2.2
If R2 is satisfied, then select “High risk”
If R2 is not satisfied, then proceed with R3.

• R3
R3.1: Blinding of participants and personnel is not reported.
R3.2: The study mentioned blinding but does not provide clear details about the blinding process.
R3 = R3.1 ∨ R3.2
If R3 is satisfied, then select “Unclear risk”

3.1 Blinding of outcome assessment
Describe all measures used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Provide any information relating to whether the intended blinding was effective.
• R1
E1 = {blinding of outcome assessment ensured and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken, the outcome measurement was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding} 
R1.1: ∃e (e ∈ E1) can be inferred from the text. 
R1.2: The text explicitly confirms that the outcome assessors were blinded (e.g., assessors were unaware of treatment groups, data were anonymized before analysis or a clear statement of blinding). Even if the term 'outcome assessor' is not explicitly used, terms such as 'digitizer,' 'analyst,' 'coder,' 'evaluator,' or 'data processor' may imply that they are outcome assessors. 
R1.3: Objective outcome measurements alone are not enough unless assessor blinding is confirmed explicitly.
R1 = (R1.1 ∨ R1.2) ∧ R1.3
If R1 is satisfied, then select “Low risk”
If R1 is not satisfied, then proceed with R2, R3.

• R2
E2 = {no blinding of outcome assessment and the outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding, the blinding of outcome assessment could have been broken and the outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding} 
R2.1: ∃e (e ∈ E2) can be inferred from the text.
R2.2: Outcome assessors have dual roles (e.g., undertaking the interventions and the outcome assessments).  
R2.3: For subjective outcomes (e.g., self-report, pain, psychological scales), lack of blinding in outcome assessment.
R2 = R2.1 ∧ R2.2 ∧ R2.3
If R2 is satisfied, then select “High risk”
If R2 is not satisfied, then proceed with R3.

• R3
R3.1: Blinding of outcome assessment is not reported.
R3.2: Outcomes are objective and measurement bias is unlikely to affect the results.
R3.3: There is no evidence of roles/context introducing bias in outcome assessment.
R3 = R3.1 ∧ R3.2 ∧ R3.3
If R3 is satisfied, then select “Unclear risk”

4.1 Incomplete outcome data
Describe the completeness of outcome data for each main outcome, including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. State whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers in each intervention group (compared with total randomized participants), reasons for attrition/exclusions where reported, and any re-inclusions in analyses performed by the review authors.
• R1
E1 = {no missing outcome data, data were available for nearly all participants randomized, missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods (e.g., intention-to-treat analysis), reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome, missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups with similar reasons for missing data across groups} 
R1.1: ∃e (e ∈ E1) can be inferred from the text. 
R1.2: A clear statement of no dropouts is provided. If dropouts are not explicitly reported, don’t assume there is no dropout.
R1.3: Dropouts were reported with a low rate, and both timing and reasons were clearly stated. 
R1.3.1: For continuous outcomes, availability of data from 90% of the participants will often be sufficient. 
R1.3.2: For dichotomous outcomes, the proportion required is directly linked to the risk of the event. If the observed number of events is much greater than the number of participants with missing outcome data, the bias would necessarily be small. 
R1 = R1.1 ∨ R1.2 ∨ R1.3
If R1 is satisfied, then select “Low risk”
If R1 is not satisfied, then proceed with R2, R3.

• R2
E2 = {high missing outcome data rate, reason for missing outcome data is likely to be related to true outcome with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups, “as-treated” analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that 
assigned at randomization, potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation} 
R2.1: ∃e (e ∈ E2) can be inferred from the text.
R2.2: If dropouts are not explicitly reported and there is a difference between the initial and final number of participants who received the intervention, calculate the dropout rate by comparing them.
R2.2.1: For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk is enough to have induced clinically relevant bias in the intervention effect estimate (usually regarded as over 20%).
R2.2.2: For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes is enough to have induced clinically relevant bias in the observed effect size, usually regarded as over 20%.
R2 = R2.1 ∧ R2.2
If R2 is satisfied, then select “High risk”
If R2 is not satisfied, then proceed with R3.

• R3
R3.1: ∀e (e ∈ (E1 ∨ E2)) cannot be inferred from the text.
R3.2: Dropouts are not reported.
R3.3: Dropout is mentioned but no specific information is given (e.g., reasons for attrition not reported).
R3 = R3.1 ∨ R3.2 ∨ R3.3
If R3 is satisfied, then select “Unclear risk”

5.1 Selective reporting
State how the possibility of selective outcome reporting was examined by the review authors, and what was found.
• R1
R1 = {the study protocol is available and all of the study’s prespecified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the prespecified way, the study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes including those that were prespecified} 
R1.1：∃e (e ∈ E1) can be inferred from the text. 
R1.2: The authors explicitly confirm that all outcomes of interest are reported (e.g., “no additional outcomes were measured”, “data for all outcomes are included”).
R1.3: Protocol is prospectively registered.
R1.4: All outcomes listed in methods are reported in results with complete statistical data (means, variances, confidence intervals) if selective reporting not explicitly stated.
R1.5: All expected outcomes were reported and no indicators of selective reporting (e.g., unplanned analysis methods or discrepant outcome data) are present in the text, despite the lack of explicit protocol details.
R1 = R1.1 ∨ R1.2 ∨ R1.3 ∨ R1.4 ∨ R1.5 
If R1 is satisfied, then select "Low risk"
If R1 is not satisfied, then proceed with R2, R3.

• R2
E2 = {not all of the study’s prespecified primary outcomes have been reported, “one or more primary outcomes have been reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not prespecified”, one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect), one or more outcomes of interest in the review have been reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis, the study report failed to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study} 
R2.1: ∃e (e ∈ E2) can be inferred from the text.
R2.2: Key statistical details (e.g., variance, sample sizes) are missing or conflict with prespecified methods.
R2.3: Changes to outcomes lack explanation (e.g., no mention of protocol amendments).
R2.4: there are any discrepancies or the same study outcomes appear with different statistical details or omissions in separate peer-reviewed publications.
R2 = R2.1 ∧ R2.2 ∧ R2.3 ∧ R2.4
If R2 is satisfied, then select “High risk”.
If R2 is not satisfied, then proceed with R3.

• R3
Unclear risk applies only when outcome reporting is ambiguous (e.g., vague descriptions like “Results partially described”, “Key metrics missing”) and no protocol exists.
If R3 is satisfied, then select “Unclear risk”

6.1 Other sources of bias
State any important concerns about bias not addressed in the other domains in the tool. If particular questions/entries were pre-specified in the review’s protocol, responses should be provided for each question/entry.
• R1
E1 = {had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used, has been claimed to have been fraudulent, had some other problem, stopped early due to some data-dependent process (including a formal-stopping rule), had extreme baseline imbalance, those recruiting individuals were aware of cluster allocation before recruitment in cluster-randomized trials, some participants were aware of cluster allocation before their recruitment in cluster-randomized trials, there was insufficient (absent or too short) time for every carryover effects to have disappeared before outcome assessment in the second period in crossover trials, the number of participants allocated to each of the two sequences is not equal and the period effects are present but not included in the analysis in crossover trials, there is a greater imbalance at the start of the second period after comparing imbalance in participant variables at the start of the second period with imbalance in variables at the start of the first period in crossover trials} 
R1.1: ∃e (e ∈ E1) can be inferred from the text.

R1 = R1.1 ∧ R1.2 ∧ R1.3
If R1 is satisfied, then select “High risk”
If R1 is not satisfied, then proceed with R2, R3.

• R2
E2 = {missing protocol/registration and outcomes differ from standard expectations (e.g., primary outcomes changed), insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias} 
R2.1: ∃e (e ∈ E2) can be inferred from the text.
R2.2: Unclear risk applies only if missing information (e.g., protocol, COI) creates plausible doubt about validity (e.g., suspected selective reporting). 
R2 = R2.1 ∧ R2.2
If R2 is satisfied, then select “Unclear risk”
If R2 is not satisfied, then proceed with R3.

• R3 
R3.1: ¬∃e (e ∈ (E1∨ E2)) can be inferred from the text.
R3.1: If the study explicitly states no conflicts of interest, no protocol deviations, or no other biases, or if no evidence of bias is mentioned (even if some details like funding sources are reported), assign low risk unless a specific high-risk factor is identified.
R3 = R3.1 ∧ R3.2
If R3 is satisfied, then select “Low risk”

## Few-shot Examples:
1.1Random sequence generation
Examples of "Low risk": “We generated the two comparison groups using simple randomization, with an equal allocation ratio, by referring to a table of random numbers.”, “We used blocked randomization to form the allocation list for the two comparison groups. We used a computer random number generator to select random permuted blocks with a block size of eight and an equal allocation ratio.”
Example of "Unclear risk": “Forty patients who were attending for routine Edgewise fixed appliance therapy were randomly allocated”
Examples of "High risk": “Patients were randomized by the first letter of the last name of their primary resident.”, “Those born on even dates were resuscitated with room air (room air group), and those born on odd dates were resuscitated with 100% oxygen (oxygen group).”

1.2Allocation concealment
Examples of "Low risk": “Opaque sealed envelopes managed by a third party”, “All study personnel was blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the study”
Examples of "Unclear risk": “the use of assignment envelopes was described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.”, “Unclear if allocation sequence concealed from those assigning patients to participant groups”, “the randomization method is described but the allocation concealment is not detailed enough”

2.1 Blinding of participants and personnel
Example of “Low risk”: “intervention and sham intervention or placebo are nearly identical (it means participants were blinded).”, “use of a sham laser with identical positioning/movement to the active intervention but without activation”
Examples of “High risk”: “participants experienced side effects or toxicities that they or carers or people delivering the interventions knew to be specific to one of the interventions.”, “Hope therapy vs. education lacked placebo procedures; participants could infer their group”
Example of “Unclear risk”: “Blinding of participants and personnel is not reported.”

3.1 Blinding of outcome assessment
Examples of “Low risk”: “all records were coded and shuffled to blind the co-researcher”, “Outcome assessors were blind to treatment status.”
Examples of "High risk": “Participants self-reported pain scores, and no blinding of assessors was described”, “one investigator assigned patients and conducted measurements”
Example of “Unclear risk”: “the authors stated that this is a double-blinded study, but the method of blinding the examiner was not described”

4.1 Incomplete outcome data
Example of “Low risk”: “Data were available for nearly all participants randomized. There was 1 dropout due to the participant's family moving away during the trial.”
Examples of “High risk”: “53 patients (83 per cent of the total study group) who continued to the second phase of treatment at T2 completed the follow-up at T3 and full records were available. 34 subjects (53 per cent of the total study group) attended a recall appointment at T4 at the mean age of 20.6 years”, “164 patients initially entered the study, and 77 completed the study (47%).”
Example of “Unclear risk”: “residents of a facility in control group were not included in analysis, but the number was not stated.”

5.1 Selective reporting
Examples of “Low risk”: “All outcomes reported”, “All outcomes listed in the methods (e.g., pain scores, functional outcomes) were reported in the results with means, SDs, and p-values. No protocol was mentioned, but no discrepancies were detected.”
Examples of "High risk": “all prespecified outcomes reported, but a composite outcome of caries incidence and retention was used. The caries information could not be extracted from the composite outcome and was not reported separately, therefore, we were unable to use the caries data from this study.”, “Data missing from a number of outcomes”
Examples of “Unclear risk”: “Clinical trial registration details not available”, “We are unsure if all planned outcomes were reported as the trial was registered retrospectively.”

6.1 Other sources of bias
Examples of "High risk": “Significant deviation from known population characteristics (e.g., gender ratios, disease severity) that suggests non-representative sampling”, “Concerns about the validity of participant inclusion criteria (e.g., questionable diagnostic methods for the condition under study).”, “Lack of reporting on intra/inter-rater reliability for critical outcomes, especially subjective measurements.” 
Examples of “Unclear risk”: “Not reported according to CONSORT guidelines”, “Trial registration missing and outcomes reported differ from standard measures”

## Workflow:
After fully understand evaluation criteria of ROB-1, you need to answer seven item questions. (1.1Random sequence generation. 1.2Allocation concealment. 2.1 Blinding of participants and personnel. 3.1 Blinding of outcome assessment. 4.1 Incomplete outcome data. 5.1 Selective reporting. 6.Other sources of bias)
For each item question:
-First, follow the reasoning steps defined above. For example, at R1, you need to consider R1.1 and R1.2 in domain 1. If the reasoning conditions for R1 are met, you draw a conclusion; otherwise, proceed to R2. Complete your reasoning step by step. Note that the content you need to locate may not come from one place, it could be from multiple sources.
-Second, refer to the examples in the few-shot examples to make an assessment. 
-Third, check whether the evaluation results are accurate.
Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.
Before you output the answer, please make sure that any evaluation results are based on my request.

## Output Format:
For each reported outcome in the RCT, provide the evaluation results in the following format:
{
      "domain": "{number, e.g., 1}",
      "syllogism": {
        "major_premise": "{Rule used to evaluate this domain}",
        "minor_premise": "{Direct supporting statement and explanation from the study text}",
        "conclusion": "{Final judgment, e.g., 'Low risk'}"
      }
}
